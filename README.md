‘Look at Me!’ is a mobile app created to promote sustainable fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse, donate, or upcycle their unused clothes. The app provides a simple, user-friendly interface where users can either take a picture of their clothing item or select a clothing category manually. This flexibility makes it easy for users to engage with the app regardless of their preferences or technical abilities.
